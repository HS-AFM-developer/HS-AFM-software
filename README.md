# HS-AFM-software

These software programs were developed at Kanazawa University and are used for research on high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). They may be freely copied and used for non-commercial research purposes. If you intend to use them for commercial purposes, please contact us in advance.

Suggestions for improvements and bug reports are welcome.

Some functions depend on the OpenTK library. Therefore, to avoid potential issues, please copy OpenTK.dll and OpenTK.GLControl.dll into the same folder as the executable file before running the software.

We would appreciate it if users who are not collaborators could acknowledge the use of these software programs in their publications.
